## 🚨 What Counts as Fraud?

Fraud can take many forms. Here are the most common examples:

- Fake listings or offers designed to trick users
- Phishing emails or impersonation
- Requests for payment outside our secure system
- Use of stolen credit cards or payment accounts
- False identity or fake profiles
- Abusive manipulation of reviews or ratings

<warning>If it seems suspicious, it probably is. Trust your instincts and don’t engage further.</warning>

## 🛡️ How to Report Fraud

You can report fraud in the following ways:

### 🔘 From a Listing or Profile

Most listings and user profiles have a **“Report”** button. Clicking this allows you to select a reason and submit evidence quickly.

### 📧 By Email

You can also email our fraud investigation team directly:

**fraud-report@example.com**  
_Subject line: “Fraud Report – [Issue Type]”_

Please include:

- Screenshots or links
- Description of the incident
- Date/time of the activity
- Any user IDs involved

<tip>Include as much detail as possible. Anonymous or vague reports are harder to act on.</tip>
