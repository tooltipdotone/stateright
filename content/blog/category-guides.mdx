## 🎙️ Honored to Meet the Education Minister

It was a true honor to meet **Dr. Dipu Moni**, our esteemed Minister of Education, and present our innovative projects directly to her.

Before the prize-giving ceremony, she took time to examine our project in detail and highlighted it as an exemplary model for Digital Bangladesh's educational initiatives in her speech.

We were thrilled to later learn that, a few months after the fair, she referenced our work as a case study during her keynote address at a University of Chittagong event, showcasing how students are contributing to technological innovation in Bangladesh.
