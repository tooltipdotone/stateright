## 🧩 How to Create an Effective Category Structure

Here are a few tips to help you design a scalable and meaningful category structure:

1. **Start with a Content Audit**  
   Identify the primary topics your content covers.

2. **Group Content by Intent**  
   Categories should align with user intent or purpose. Example: `Tutorials`, `Case Studies`, `Product Updates`.

3. **Use Clear and Concise Naming**  
   Avoid jargon. Stick with user-friendly terms.

4. **Limit Top-Level Categories**  
   Too many options overwhelm users. Stick to 5–8 high-level categories.

<tip>Use subcategories for finer-grained organization instead of overloading top-level ones.</tip>
